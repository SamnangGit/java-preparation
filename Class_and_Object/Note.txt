OOP (Object Oriented Programing) a programming paradigm that everything is based on class and object
= Reduce Code Complexity
= Maintainable
= Reusable 

4 Pillars of OOP
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymprphism
* Abstraction

Class is a blueprint to create Object+
Class consist data member and Method

Object is an instence of a Class
Objects are independent 
Object is a reference type
